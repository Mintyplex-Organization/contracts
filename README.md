# Mintyplex COSMWASM SMART CONTRACT

This smart contract acts as factory which actors known as "Creator" can use to create Non-transferable CW721s\NFTs(Products). Once the Product is created, another set of actors known as "Shoppers" can mint them for a fee to their address but they won't be able to transfer them to another wallet since the products are non-transferable.
